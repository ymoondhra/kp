					I&#39;m from the suburbs of South Florida. I couldn&#39;t stand the humidity so I went to college in California (UCLA). When I first came to campus, I was stunned by the fact that legendary alumni, like Jackie Robinson and Coach John Wooden, had walked the same steps as me when they were my age. Dozens of UCLA students walked past me every day as I stood in front of the alumni&#39;s statues. I realized that I had the privilege of being in an environment where anything was possible, so I dared to dream big. Inspired by the journeys of these athletes, I wanted to work my hardest towards a very ambitious long-term vision of myself. I planned out a timeline of career milestones and wrote it on a flashcard, which I have kept in my wallet for three years.

					I have been performing drums at pubs, school events, and many other venues for eleven years. The euphoria I feel when playing great music is something I want everyone to experience. In retrospect, performing for audiences built a deep desire in me to inspire joy in others.
				</p>
				<p>
					I want people to live happy, fulfilling lives. There are multiple ways I strive to make this impact. In my daily life, I often find myself starting spontaneous, funny conversations with random people and greeting my friends with a big smile. My childhood years in Hindu Sunday school taught me that many people do not get to experience life this way. This led me to found the Interact Club at my high school. We raised $40K for children with cancer. I believe we can also make a huge impact on people we are closest to. I want to be more loving towards my parents, who unconditionally love me and have made many sacrifices for me to have a better life than they did.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my first year at UCLA, I wrote my career goals on the flashcard to push myself far beyond my mental limits. Then, I realized I could use my effort for a cause greater than myself by building a company that enables others to make the most of their lives. Now, I don&#39;t just <i>want</i> to accomplish my career goals and inspire greatness in others &#8211; it is my duty to try my best to do so.

					One day, I walked through the area with the names of every UCLA graduate who made it to the NCAA and Olympics. I found myself returning there every day, inspired by the athletes&#39; journeys of discipline, commitment, and sacrifice. I memorized 90 of their names in the order they appeared on the plaques and recited them daily from memory. Before every internship interview, I drew the Olympic rings on my arm with one goal in mind: intern at the world&#39;s best company. This fulfilling journey made me certain that I will live the remainder of my life with the commitment of an Olympic athlete.

					I always saw something special in one of the founders of Duffl. Unfortunately, he was losing faith in himself. He was being bullied by another Duffl founder, and the memories of his abusive childhood only made things worse. I chased after him one day after he said &#34;I quit&#34; and walked out in tears. Helping him discover what he was capable of becoming turned out to be deeply fulfilling for me. Together, we fired the people bringing negativity into the company, including the CEO, and lost our $1.0M seed fund as a result. Then, we rebuilt Duffl from the ground up.

							It has reached over 11,000 views on Medium and was added the "The Startup", Medium&#39;s largest publication (750K followers). 
							To my surprise, several people reached out to me, inspired and motivated:

							I used to skip classes in high school because I couldn&#39;t stop playing the marimba. The art teachers neighboring the marimba&#39;s practice room knew me too well, and my band teachers often used to tell me to &#34;go home&#34; as they were heading out. The following video generated 25,000 YouTube views and many positive comments, but I don&#39;t think those quantifiable metrics are as important as the fulfilling journey I had through learning this piece:
